Hi, 

We at https://bitcontrol.ch specialize in connecting micro-controller boards via field buses. The lower layers are easy, ther higher layers are not.

You can reach us at info@bitcontrol.ch. We're based in Switzerland, the smallest but most beautiful country in the heart of Europe.

Any question or feedback is welcome.

Cheers,
Andreas
