Hi, 

At https://bitcontrol.ch we specialize in connecting micro-controller boards via field buses. In our experience, the lower layers are easy to program, the higher layers are not. Thus we've specialized in field bus design, implementation and testing.

You can reach us at info@bitcontrol.ch. We're based in Switzerland, a small country right in the heart of Europe.

Questions or feedback are welcome.

Cheers,
Andreas
