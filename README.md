Hello,

At https://bitcontrol.ch we specialize in connecting micro-controller boards via field buses. In our experience, the lower layers are easy to program, the higher layers are not. Thus we've specialized in field bus design that encompasses all layers, and includes documentation, implementation and tests.

You can reach us at info@bitcontrol.ch. We're based in Switzerland, a small country right in the heart of Europe.

Holderadio,
Andreas
